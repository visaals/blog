## Hi, I'm Visaal Ambalam.

I enjoy building (and occasionally writing) things and sharing them with the world. 

I love playing racquet sports, drinking boba, making pour over, and hanging out with people.

I build software at [nightfall.ai](https://nightfall.ai/careers) to prevent companies from accidentally sharing your data where it's not supposed to be (like unencrypted emails or slack messages).

I tend to be ruthlessly practical (for better or worse).

I am fascinated by technology because it's the closest thing to magic that we have, especially when it meaningfully helps people.

## In the past,

I thought I wanted to be a doctor.

I realized I like building things a lot more.

I studied Computer Science and Math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/).

I built web apps at [Cerner (acquired by Oracle)](https://twitter.com/Cerner) and [ObodoHub](https://obodohub.com/).

I built big data distributed systems at [Liveramp](https://liveramp.com/for-engineers).

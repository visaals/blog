## Hi, I'm Visaal Ambalam.

I am a software engineer [Liveramp](https://liveramp.com/for-engineers), currently enjoying the process of learning how to build distributed systems. 

I am an aspiring content creator, hence this [blog](https://www.visaalambalam.com/posts/)!

I tend to be ruthlessly practical (for better or worse).

I am fascinated by the implications of the internet on society.

## In the past,

I thought I wanted to be a doctor.

I realized I like building things.

I built web apps at [Cerner](https://twitter.com/Cerner) and [ObodoHub](https://obodohub.com/).

I studied Computer Science and Math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/).

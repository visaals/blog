## Hi, I'm Visaal Ambalam.

I am a software engineer [Nightfall AI](https://nightfall.ai/careers), where I'm helping build an API to detect sensitive information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, PHI, and more.

I am an aspiring content creator, hence this [blog](https://www.visaalambalam.com/posts/)!

I tend to be ruthlessly practical (for better or worse).

I am fascinated by technology because it's the closest thing we have to to magic.

## In the past,

I thought I wanted to be a doctor.

I realized I like building things.

I studied Computer Science and Math at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/).

I built web apps at [Cerner (acquired by Oracle)](https://twitter.com/Cerner) and [ObodoHub](https://obodohub.com/).

I built big data distributed systems at [Liveramp](https://liveramp.com/for-engineers).
